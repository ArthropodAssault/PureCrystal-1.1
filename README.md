**Change log**

Pokemon availability:
==================
Mareep has been added to route 32 and mareep and flaaffy to routes 42 and 43. 

Miscellaneous significant changes:
=========================

There is a tradeback NPC in the Goldenrod City PP speech house to evolve pokemon that mandate a trade. 

The Goldenrod City move tutor is now available after beating Jasmine. He still appears on Wednesday and Saturday. The cost of a move is now 1,000 coins instead of 4,000. If you are buying the coins, this is a cost reduction from 80,000 to 20,000.

The 6 evolution stones are available from the Cianwood mart, including water, fire, thunder, leaf, moon, and sun stones. The stones cost 5,000 each. 

The opponent status & stat altering move 25% accuracy debuff is no longer in the game. All opponent status moves have their normal accuracy. 

The clock may now be changed by simultaneously pressing down, B, and select on the title screen. There is no longer a password requirement.

All marts provide rare candies free of charge. This includes the Cianwood, Mahogany, and Indigo Plateau marts. In the Goldenrod Department Store rare candies are available on the 4th floor. In the Celadon Department Store they are on the 5th floor. They are not sold in the Goldenrod Underground. 

Moveset changes: 
================

Graveler and Golem now learn rock slide via level up. Graveler will learn it if it evolves from geodude at level 25. Otherwise, it can be learned as golem at level 32. 

HMs are now deleteable

Base stat changes: 
===============================

All three pokemon in the totodile line have their attack and special attack stats reversed. Special attack is now higher to better align with the line's typing. This makes totodile worse in the early game, when it does not have a special move and relies on scratch and rage. 

Item changes: 
============

The earthquake, psychic, and giga drain TMs are now available earlier. 

An earthquake TM is found on the 5th floor of the radio tower. The eathquake TM in Victory road is still there.

The psychic TM can be found in one of the switch rooms of the rocket underground. It remains available in Kanto from Mr. Psychic in Saffron City. The switch order to reach the southwest room with the TM is right, left, middle, right, left. You can pass back up the stairs to reset the gates to allow you to hit the switches again to proceed throught the Rocket side quest. 

The giga drain TM can be found on the 6th floor of the Olivine Lighthouse. Erika also gives the TM. 

The metal coat can now be found on the 5th floor of the Olivine Lighthouse. You still obtain it in the other ways you could in vanilla Crystal: on the SS Aqua after finding the gentleman's grandaughter, via the Power Plant magneton trade, and by stealing from wild magnemite. 

Trainer party changes: 
======================

The Kanto gym leaders all have their pokemon's levels increased to create a more normal level curve. 

Bruno's onix is now a steelix. It's moveset is unchanged - it uses earthquake, rock slide, sandstorm, and bind. 

All of Brock's pokemon are fully evolved. IE - he now uses golem, rhydon, and steelix instead of graveler, rhyhorn, and onix. Their movesets are unchanged.
